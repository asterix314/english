== Test 3

=== Task 1
The charts below give information about a public library in a town called Little Chalfont.

#figure(image("/img/cam20T3-1.png", width: 80%))

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.]


#作文(words: 215, timing: 40)[The charts give 3 kind of information about Little Chalfont Library.

1. Membership breakdown by age group. As of 2016, more than half (51%) of the library's members are adults from 18 to 64 years of age. The next largest group is children under 13 which takes up 22% of total membership, followed by teenagers under 18 (15%), then older adults over 64 (12%).

2. Book loans breakdown by category. In accordance with the age group breakdown of the same year, the most popular loans are adult fiction and children's fiction, each taking 38% of total loans. For adults, the next favorable categories are adult non-fiction (13%) and adult audio books (2%). As for children, they also prefer non-fiction (6%), followed by children's DVDs (1%). The young adults category only account for 2% of the total loans, much less than their membership proportion, in contrast to children whose loans exceed by far their membership.

3. Total number of loans from 2007 to 2016. We can see from the bar chart that the library's total loans grew from a bit over 15,000 in 2007 to just above 20,000 in 2011 before it declined somewhat to under 20,000 in 2013. Then the loans increased again steadily up until 2016 at around 22,000, where the data is truncated.]

=== Task 2
Some people have decided to reduce the number of times they fly every year or to stop flying altogether. Do you think the environmental benefits of this development outweigh the disadvantages for individuals and businesses?]

#作文(timing: 58, words: 253)[To reduce carbon emission, some environmentally concerned people have decided to limit their flights or even give up flying altogether. While this is laudable to put the environment before one's own expediency, the actual benefits might be minimal.

Firstly, it's not immediately clear that other means of transportation effectively emit less carbon than airplanes. The extra carbon incurred by driving, for example, in lieu of flying, may collectively surpass by far the amount of petroline saved in the plane's oil tank: a flight will still take off in spite of a few cancellations. Indeed, only a tiny fraction of people will opt out of a flight in reality for environmental reasons, and the net effect may well be more carbon released.

It's only when flight reductions reaches a critical mass can we start to talk about its environmental benefits, but at what costs? For starters, some long distance travels are only practical by air -- its timeliness is essential for global business travels. Even at the individual level, a flight's ease and efficiency is so taken for granted that its absence is enough to put a top to a holidy plan. In other words, the cost of a significant reduction in air travel is stalled businesses and frastrated
people that may drastically outweigh the environmental benefits. After all, protecting the environment is a means to produce healthy businesses and happy people.

In summary, the environmental benefits of limited flights are dubious at best, but their practical impact on business and individuals are detrimental. ]
