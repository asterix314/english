Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.]


#作文(words: 215, timing: 40, date: "2025-12-09")[The charts give 3 kind of information about Little Chalfont Library. #issue[][缺少一个清晰的总体概述]

1. #issue[][正式雅思写作通过自然段落组织内容，不要使用编号。] Membership #praise[breakdown][准确的学术词汇] by age group. As of 2016, more than half (51%) of the library's members are adults from 18 to 64 years of age. The next largest group is children under 13 which takes up 22% of total membership, followed by teenagers under 18 (15%), then older adults over 64 (12%).

2. Book loans breakdown by category. In accordance with the age group breakdown of the same year, the most popular loans are adult fiction and children's fiction, each taking 38% of total loans. For adults, the next favorable categories are adult non-fiction (13%) and adult audio books (2%). As for children, they also prefer non-fiction (6%), followed by children's DVDs (1%). The young adults category only #typo[account][三单accounts] for 2% of the total loans, much less than their membership proportion, #praise[in contrast][有意义的比较] to children whose loans exceed by far their membership.

3. Total number of loans from 2007 to 2016. We can see from the bar chart that the library's total loans grew from #issue[a bit][避免口语用词] over 15,000 in 2007 to just above 20,000 in 2011 before it declined somewhat to under 20,000 in 2013. Then the loans increased again steadily up until 2016 at around 22,000, #issue[where the data is truncated][不必要的主观推测].]

- 优点：
  + 你准确识别了三张图表的核心信息：会员年龄结构、图书借阅类别、借阅总量十年趋势。
  + 数据引用基本准确（如 51%、38%、22,000 等）。
  + 做了有意义的比较（例如指出儿童借阅比例远高于其会员比例，而青年借阅比例偏低）。

- 可改进之处：
  + 缺少一个清晰的“Overview”（总体概述段）。根据 Band 7+ 要求，必须在开头或结尾提供一个不包含具体数据的总览句，概括主要趋势（如：会员以成年人为主；小说类图书最受欢迎；十年间借阅量总体上升）。你目前的结构是直接进入细节，这会影响 TA 分数。
  + 最后一句“where the data is truncated”不必要，且带有主观推测（考官只要求描述已有数据）。
][
- 优点：
  + 采用分点式结构（1. 2. 3.）虽非正式段落，但逻辑清晰。
  + 使用了“followed by”“in contrast to”“as for”等衔接手段。
- 可改进之处：
  + 正式雅思写作不应使用编号（1. 2. 3.），而应通过自然段落组织内容（通常 4 段：引言 + overview + 图1&2细节 + 图3趋势）。
  + 段落间缺乏过渡句。例如从会员结构跳到借阅类别时，可加一句：“In terms of borrowing preferences, fiction dominates across age groups.”
  + 指代略显重复，如多次使用“the library's...”。
][
- 优点：
  + 使用了较准确的学术词汇：breakdown, proportion, favorable categories, in contrast to, exceeds 等。
  + 尝试使用多样表达（如“takes up”“account for”“prefer”）。

- 可改进之处：
  + 有些用词不够精准。例如“favorable categories”应为 “preferred categories”。
  + 可增加更地道的学术表达，如 “constitute” “predominate” “exhibit a steady upward trend” 等。
  + 避免口语化表达如“We can see from...”（应改为“The bar chart illustrates...”）。
][
- 优点：
  + 句式有一定变化，使用了复合句（如“In accordance with..., the most popular...”）。
  + 大部分语法结构正确。

- 可改进之处：
  + 主谓一致错误：“the young adults category only account” → 应为 “accounts”。
  + 时态统一性：借阅数据是过去（2007–2016），应统一用过去时（如 “grew”, “declined”, “increased” 是对的，但开头描述会员结构应用 “As of 2016, more than half...” 是现在完成时/一般过去时均可，但需统一）。
  + 标点细节：英文中“15,000”正确，但“a bit over 15,000”略显口语，可改为 “just over 15,000”]

#范文[The charts illustrate three aspects of Little Chalfont Library’s usage in 2016 and borrowing trends between 2007 and 2016.

Overall, adults aged 18–64 constituted the majority of library members, and fiction—both adult and children’s—accounted for the largest share of loans. Additionally, total book loans showed a general upward trajectory over the ten-year period.

In 2016, 51% of library members were adults between 18 and 64 years old, making this the largest demographic group. Children under 13 represented 22% of members, followed by teenagers (aged 13–17) at 15%, while those aged 65 and over formed the smallest group at 12%.

Regarding borrowing preferences, fiction was overwhelmingly popular across age groups. Specifically, adult fiction and children’s fiction each accounted for 38% of all loans. Adult non-fiction made up a much smaller proportion (13%), while adult audio books and children’s DVDs represented only 2% and 1% respectively. Notably, children’s borrowing activity was disproportionately high relative to their membership share, whereas teenagers borrowed far less than their membership percentage would suggest.

From 2007 to 2016, total loans rose from just over 15,000 to approximately 22,000. Despite a slight dip between 2011 and 2013, the overall trend was clearly upward, with the highest number of loans recorded in the final year.]

=== Task 2
Some people have decided to reduce the number of times they fly every year or to stop flying altogether. Do you think the environmental benefits of this development outweigh the disadvantages for individuals and businesses?]

#作文(timing: 58, words: 253, date: "2025-12-11")[To reduce carbon emission, some environmentally concerned people have decided to limit their flights or even give up flying altogether. While this is laudable to put the environment before one's own expediency, the actual benefits might be minimal. #praise[][观点明确]

Firstly, it's not immediately clear that other means of transportation effectively emit less carbon than airplanes. The extra carbon incurred by driving, for example, in lieu of flying, may collectively surpass by far the amount of #typo[petroline][petrol] saved in the plane's oil tank: a flight will still take off in spite of a few cancellations. Indeed, only a tiny fraction of people will opt out of a flight in reality for environmental reasons, and the net effect may well be more carbon released. #issue[][未提供数据或合理推演]

It's only when flight #issue[reductions reaches][主谓一致错误] a #issue[critical mass][“关键临界规模”概念需要深入解释。] can we start to talk about its environmental benefits, but at what costs? For starters, some long distance travels are only practical by air -- #praise[its timeliness][指代清晰] is essential for global business #issue[travels][应为不可数名词travel]. Even at the individual level, a flight's ease and efficiency is so taken for granted that its absence is enough to put a #typo[top][stop] to a #typo[holidy][holiday] plan. In other words, the cost of a significant reduction in air travel is stalled businesses and #typo[frastrated][frustrated] people that may drastically outweigh the environmental benefits. After all, protecting the environment is a means to produce healthy businesses and happy people.

In summary, the environmental benefits of limited flights are dubious at best, but their practical impact on business and individuals are detrimental.]

考生清晰表达了立场（“环境效益存疑，而对个人和企业的负面影响更大”），并围绕两个方面提供了相关论点：一是飞行替代方式未必更环保，二是航空对商务与个人出行具有不可替代性。然而，部分论据缺乏充分展开。例如“开车排放可能更多”这一观点未提供数据或合理推演；“关键临界规模”概念虽有提及但未深入解释。这些特征符合 Band 6 “观点相关但部分欠发展，支持可能不足”的描述。

- 优点：立场明确，结构完整（引言-主体-结论）。
- 不足：论证深度有限，缺乏具体例证。
][
全文逻辑清晰，段落推进自然：首段提出立场，第二段质疑环境效益，第三段强调社会成本，结尾总结。衔接手段使用灵活，如“Firstly”、“Indeed”、“In other words”、“After all”等，有效引导读者理解论证层次。段落内部句间衔接紧密，指代清晰（如“its timeliness”、“their absence”）。虽有个别重复（如多次强调“benefits are dubious”），但整体符合 Band 7 “逻辑组织清晰，衔接手段灵活，偶有小瑕疵”的标准。

- 优点：逻辑流畅，衔接自然，段落功能明确。
- 不足：第三段末句因拼写错误（“frastrated”）略影响阅读流畅性，但未破坏整体连贯。
][
词汇基本满足任务需求，能使用如“laudable”、“expediency”、“detrimental”、“critical mass”、“timeliness”等较正式词汇，显示一定范围。但存在明显拼写错误（“petroline”应为“petrol”或“fuel”；“frastrated”应为“frustrated”；“holidy”应为“holiday”；“top”应为“stop”），且部分用词不准确。整体词汇选择尚可传达意思，但缺乏 Band 7 所要求的“精准性与惯用搭配意识”。

- 优点：尝试使用学术词汇，基本达意。
- 不足：拼写错误频出，个别表达不地道，影响词汇评分上限。
][
考生能混合使用简单句与复杂句（如条件句“When...”、让步状语从句“While...”、定语从句“that may drastically outweigh...”），显示一定语法广度。但错误较频繁：

1. 主谓一致错误：“flight reductions reaches” → 应为“reach”；
2. 冠词缺失：“for global business travels” → 应为“for global business travel”（不可数）；
3. 拼写干扰语法判断（如“frastrated people”）。

尽管多数句子仍可理解，但错误频率高于 Band 7 “语法总体受控，常见无错误句”的要求，符合 Band 6 “语法/标点错误存在但很少阻碍理解”的描述。

- 优点：尝试复杂结构，基本句型准确。
- 不足：系统性语法错误（主谓一致、不可数名词）和拼写问题拉低分数。
]

总体建议（针对最弱项：Task Response 与 Lexical Resource）

1. 深化论证并添加具体例证：在提出“开车排放可能更高”时，可简要说明人均公里碳排放数据（如“a car emits ~170g CO₂/km per passenger vs. a plane’s ~90g”），即使不精确，也能体现“relevant example”；商务出行部分可举“国际会议、紧急合同签署”等实例，以满足题目要求并提升 TR 至 Band 7。

2. 加强词汇准确性与拼写训练：重点检查易错词（如 holiday, frustrated, fuel），避免因拼写错误掩盖词汇能力；多积累地道搭配。

3. 精修语法细节：特别注意主谓一致（复数主语+复数动词）和不可数名词（travel, information, advice）的用法，可通过朗读检查语感。


#范文[In recent years, a growing number of individuals have chosen to limit or abandon air travel in an effort to reduce their carbon footprint. While this shift reflects commendable environmental awareness, I believe that the ecological advantages of such a trend are often overstated and may not justify the significant economic and social costs it imposes on both individuals and businesses.

From an environmental perspective, the impact of individual flight reduction is marginal unless adopted at a systemic level. A single transatlantic flight emits roughly one to two tonnes of CO₂ per passenger—undoubtedly substantial—but aviation accounts for only about 2–3% of global emissions. Moreover, if only a small segment of the population voluntarily forgoes flying while global air traffic continues to expand, the net reduction in emissions remains negligible. Crucially, the environmental benefit would only become meaningful if accompanied by large-scale policy changes, such as investment in sustainable aviation fuels or high-speed rail infrastructure, rather than relying on personal sacrifice alone.

On the other hand, the repercussions for individuals and enterprises can be profound. For individuals, long-haul flights are often the only feasible means of maintaining transnational family ties, accessing remote travel destinations, or attending significant life events. For businesses—especially small and medium-sized enterprises—air travel remains indispensable for international negotiations, supply chain management, and market expansion. A blanket reduction in flying could hinder global collaboration, delay critical projects, and disproportionately affect industries such as tourism, logistics, and consulting. In extreme cases, it might even provoke job losses or reduced economic mobility, outcomes that arguably undermine broader societal well-being more than the modest environmental gains offset.

That said, this does not mean we should ignore aviation’s environmental toll. Rather than advocating for universal flight abstinence, a more effective approach would involve technological innovation, carbon offset programs, and government regulation to decouple economic activity from emissions.

In conclusion, while the intention behind reducing air travel is environmentally virtuous, its actual ecological payoff at the individual level is limited, whereas the disadvantages for personal and commercial life are tangible and substantial. Therefore, the environmental benefits do not, in most realistic scenarios, outweigh the drawbacks.]
