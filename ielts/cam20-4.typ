#评价(tr: 7, cc: 7, lr:7, gra: 7)[
- 优点:
  + 你成功识别并概述了整个生产过程的主要阶段：种植、收割、切割、粉碎、过滤、软化、纺纱、织布、制成成品。
  + 文章涵盖了图表中的所有关键步骤，并指出了从植物到服装的最终产出。
  + 你尝试进行了比较（“not too different from that of making paper” 和 “merges with the process of making silk”），这显示了你理解题目的要求是“make comparisons where relevant”。

- 不足与改进建议:
  + 细节不准确/遗漏: 你在描述第 6 步时说“softened by mixing them with water and amine oxide”，但原文图示中明确写的是“add water and amine oxide”，并未说明是“混合”。更精确的说法应是“经过添加水和氧化胺处理”。此外，你提到“stems and leaves”，但图示只显示了“cut into strips”，并未区分茎和叶，这是不必要的细节添加。
  + 比较不够深入: 将其与造纸和丝绸制作的类比虽然有趣，但过于笼统且缺乏依据。考官希望看到基于数据或流程本身的客观比较，例如：“与传统棉纺不同，竹纤维需要通过化学溶剂（如氧化胺）进行溶解和再生，这一过程更接近人造丝的生产方式。” 这样会更贴合图表信息。
  + 结尾句问题: 最后一句感叹句“Isn't it amazing...”在学术写作中属于主观抒情，不符合 Task 1 客观描述的要求，会被视为偏离任务。

- 改进方向: 专注于准确、客观地报告图表信息，避免主观评论和不必要的推测。确保每一个细节都忠实于图表，不要自行添加未提及的内容。
][
- 优点:
  + 文章整体结构清晰，按照时间顺序（从种植到成品）展开，逻辑流畅。
  + 使用了基本的连接词，如 “First”, “Next”, “So far”, “But what comes next”, “And from these fabric”，使段落间有过渡。
  + 段落划分合理，第一段介绍总览，第二三段描述具体步骤，第四段总结。

- 不足与改进建议:
  + 衔接词单一/机械: 过度依赖简单的顺序词（First, Next），可以引入更多样化的连接词来体现步骤间的因果关系或转折，例如：“Following this, the strips are crushed...”, “Subsequently, the long fibres are filtered...”, “A crucial step involves...”。
  + 句子内部衔接不足: 部分句子较长，结构略显松散，例如 “...from which long fibres are then filtered out and then softened...”，可以拆分或重组以增强可读性。
  + 代词指代需更清晰: 如 “these strips”, “them” 在上下文中虽可理解，但在高分作文中应力求绝对清晰。

- 改进方向: 增加衔接词的多样性，特别是表示因果、转折、递进的词汇。注意句子内部的逻辑连接，避免过长的复合句。
][
- 优点:
  + 使用了与主题相关的词汇，如 “harvested”, “crushed”, “filtered”, “softened”, “spindles”, “woven”, “bolts of fabric”, “end product”，显示出一定的词汇量。
  + 尝试使用了一些较高级的词汇，如 “depicts”, “end-to-end process”, “orderly pipeline”，体现了词汇使用的灵活性。

- 不足与改进建议:
  + 词汇重复: 多次使用 “process” 和 “fabric”，可以替换为 “procedure”, “manufacturing method”, “textile”, “material” 等同义词。
  + 用词不够精准: “get cut into strips” 中的 “get” 过于口语化，应改为 “are cut” 或 “undergo cutting”。“is transformed into” 可以更精确地表述为 “is processed into” 或 “becomes”。
  + 搭配错误: “spin them to make spindles of yarn” 不够准确。通常我们说 “spin fibres into yarn”，而 “spindles” 是纺纱机上的部件，不是最终产品。应改为 “spin the fibres into yarn”。
  + 拼写/语法小错: “autum” 应为 “autumn”。

- 改进方向: 注重词汇的精确性和多样性。多查阅同义词词典，避免重复。特别注意专业术语的正确使用（如 “yarn” 而非 “spindles of yarn”）。
][
- 优点:
  + 能够运用多种句式，包括简单句、复合句和复杂句，如 “First, bamboo sprouts are planted... when they are harvested...”。
  + 大部分句子语法正确，时态使用恰当（主要使用一般现在时描述流程）。
  + 能够使用被动语态（如 “are planted”, “are harvested”, “are crushed”），这在描述流程图时是恰当的。

- 不足与改进建议:
  + 句式多样性不足: 虽然有复杂句，但结构相对单一，多为 “主语 + 动词 + 时间/地点状语” 的模式。可以尝试使用分词短语、定语从句等来增加句式变化，例如：“After being harvested in autumn, the bamboo is transported to the factory...”。
  + 语法小错误: “sprouts are planted... and grow to appropriate heights in autum, when they are harvested...” 这个句子中，“sprouts” 是种子发芽后的幼苗，直接“planted”不太准确，应为 “bamboo plants are planted”。
  + 标点问题: 最后一句感叹号在正式写作中不合适。

- 改进方向: 主动练习使用不同的语法结构，如非谓语动词、定语从句、条件句等。仔细检查标点符号和句子结构，确保语法完全正确。]

#经验总结[长句太多。常常一句话覆盖了几个加工步骤，导致句式呆板和衔接词不足。宜像下面范文那样把步骤拆分开，可以有更多的机会使用衔接词和代词，显得行文有条不紊。]

#范文[The diagram illustrates the manufacturing process for producing fabric from bamboo, detailing the sequential stages from cultivation to the creation of finished garments.

The production begins with the planting of bamboo seedlings during the spring season. These plants are allowed to mature throughout the year and are subsequently harvested in autumn. Following harvest, the bamboo stalks are transported to a processing facility where they are mechanically cut into smaller strips.

These strips then undergo crushing to produce a liquid pulp. From this pulp, a filtration process separates the long fibres, which are essential for textile production. A key stage involves treating these fibres with a mixture of water and amine oxide, which renders them soft and suitable for spinning. The softened fibres are then fed into machinery that spins them into continuous strands of yarn.

Finally, this yarn is woven on looms to create bolts of fabric. This textile material is then utilized by manufacturers to produce a wide array of consumer goods, including T-shirts, socks, and shorts, among other apparel items.

In summary, the transformation of bamboo into wearable fabric involves a multi-stage industrial process that combines mechanical and chemical treatments, ultimately yielding versatile textiles for everyday use.]


=== Task 2
Many aspects of the way people dress today are influenced by global fashion trends. How has global fashion become such a strong influence on people's lives? Do you think this is a positive or negative development?]

#作文(words: 320, timing: 50, date: "2025-12-16")[What are you wearing today? Chances are, no matter where you come from, you are wearing in a style that's readily recognizalbe and more or less just like everybody else: a suit and tie, or jeans and shirt, a hoodied outfit, or perhaps carrying a Gucci handbag and a pair of chic sunglasses to match: all dress codes molded by global fashion trends. It's amazing, isn't it, that a world of people so diverse in culture and tradtitions and indeed historical dressing designs, should in the end converge to really only one style in their choice of clothing: the style of consumerism.

That's it. Consumersim is the reason why a Chinese, an Indian, or a Turk are all dressed like an urban yappie in San Fransisco. Nobody can really escape, because the power of consumerism is all too great. You can wear the Chinese traditional garment when you feel like it, with its long sleeves and ornate headdress, while taking a measured walk in an ancient temple, posing for pictures. But try going to work with that -- more than a few eyebrows will be raised, to say the least. As the global population are united under capitalism and consumerism is king, there is little doubt that people should dress accordingly.

Consumerism as the global fashion trend has its benefits: it's efficient, flexible, and still leaves enough room for individual expression, though always with a commercial undertone. Instead of spending half an hour perfecting the twines of the toga, a baseball cap would suffice. Also, traditional clothing is admittedly often cumbersome for modern life -- think of how many cups of coffee and stacks of files would be knocked over by that watery, folded sleeve of the Chinese traditional garment. These benefits make it hard to go back to the traditional garments.

Therefore, with modernity and practicality in mind, most people would vote for the consumerism trend in clothing design.]

#范文[Global fashion has undeniably become a dominant force shaping personal attire across the world. This phenomenon stems primarily from the rise of digital connectivity, the proliferation of fast fashion brands, and the global spread of Western-centric consumer culture. While this trend promotes convenience and fosters a sense of global belonging, it also risks eroding cultural sartorial diversity—a loss that warrants serious concern.

The ascendancy of global fashion is largely propelled by the internet and social media. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok enable instantaneous exposure to trends from fashion capitals such as Paris, Milan, or Seoul, creating a shared visual language that transcends borders. Simultaneously, multinational retailers like Zara and Shein deploy highly efficient supply chains to deliver runway-inspired pieces to consumers worldwide within weeks, effectively standardising aesthetic preferences. Moreover, global advertising campaigns often equate modernity and success with specific Western-style clothing—such as tailored suits or minimalist athleisure—further reinforcing conformity.

From a practical standpoint, this homogenisation offers undeniable benefits. Standardised clothing simplifies daily decisions, enhances professional uniformity in multinational workplaces, and allows individuals to express identity through globally understood symbols—be it a luxury handbag or a branded sneaker. However, the downside is profound: traditional garments, rich in cultural symbolism and craftsmanship, are increasingly relegated to ceremonial occasions or tourist performances. In many societies, younger generations view indigenous attire as outdated or impractical, accelerating cultural amnesia.

In conclusion, while global fashion undeniably brings efficiency and cross-cultural connectivity, its homogenising effect poses a significant threat to cultural heritage. A more balanced approach—one that embraces global trends without discarding local textile traditions—would be a far more sustainable and enriching path forward.]]
