Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.]

#作文(timing: 36, words: 174, date: "2025-12-31")[The line graph shows the number of people participating in 5 activities at one social centre in Melbourne for a period of 20 years.

In overview, the film club attracted the highest number of participants throughout the period shown. Moreover, the number of people interested in table tennis saw a sharp increase in the recent decade.

In 2000, the film club already enjoyed a membership of 65 people, while the figure of the other three activities -- martial arts, amateur dramatics, and table tennis -- stayed well behind at 36, 27, and 16 respectively. As the years progressed, the membership of the film club and martial arts held roughly stable.

On the other hand, the figure for table tennis began to rise dramatically after 2010, reaching a peak of 53 in 2020. In contrast, the participants of amateur dramatics has been steadily declining since 2005, to only under 10 people in 2020. Musical performances, a new activity that began in 2005 and has been gaining popularity, enjoyed a membership of 9 people in 2020.]

#范文[The line graph illustrates changes in participation levels across five different activities at a social centre in Melbourne between 2000 and 2020.

Overall, the film club maintained its position as the most popular activity throughout the two decades, while table tennis witnessed the most significant growth, particularly after 2010. In contrast, amateur dramatics experienced a continuous decline, and musical performances — introduced in 2005 — gradually gained traction among participants.

In 2000, the film club attracted 65 participants, far exceeding the numbers for martial arts (36), amateur dramatics (27), and table tennis (16). Over the following years, participation in the film club fluctuated slightly but remained consistently above 60, peaking at 67 in 2020. Similarly, martial arts saw modest variations, ranging from 34 to 38 participants, indicating relative stability.

Meanwhile, table tennis began to rise sharply from 2010 onwards, surging from 20 participants to 53 by 2020 — surpassing all other activities except the film club. Conversely, amateur dramatics, which started with 27 participants, declined steadily to just 6 by 2020. Notably, musical performances, which were not offered before 2005, emerged as a growing interest, increasing from zero to 19 participants over the next 15 years.]

=== Task 2
Some people think that competition at work, at school and in daily life is a good thing. Others believe that we should try to cooperate more, rather than competing against each other.

Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.
