=== Task 2
In most countries, prison is an effective solution for the problem of crime. Some people think a more effective solution is to provide a better education. To what extent do you agree or disagree?]

#作文(timing: 80, words: 317, date: "2025-12-17")[Since the dawn of history, human civilization has been afflicted #typo[with][by] crimes. To counter this age-old vice, #praise[incarceration][精准学术词汇] is offered as the ready solution. Its effectiveness as both punishment and deterrence is time tested, one assumes -- or is it? #praise[Might not][反问句在风格上很出色] a better education, argue some #issue[humanely-minded souls][学术写作不宜太过文学化], #typo[proove][prove] to be a more effective alternative? #issue[][在引言中应更明确陈述你的立场]

#issue[There are "seven sins" in the Christian doctrine][“七宗罪”似乎与文章主旨关系不大], for indeed, crime is a broad term which covers a variety of different offences, each with its own socio-economic or psychological underpinning. Take theft for instance, which is commonly associated with a lack of ready cash. The same can be said of #typo[robery][robbery], #typo[burglery][burglary], and some others to a large extent: these all arise from a lack of economic #typo[subsistance][subsistence]. Can education remedy such offences? Probably not effectively -- the root cause is economic inequity; the immediate solution is jobs, not a classroom.

Another category is the more physical felonies: violence, murder, rape, and so on. It can be argued that these tend to be the result of bad influence from an early age: one thinks of gangsters who dropped out of school as teenagers. #issue[This][指代易误解为gangsters] is also the category where #issue[better education][对better education的具体内涵一直未界定] is most applicable. In comparison, jail time is almost counter-productive in this case.

Last but not least, we should not forget crimes of an even darker shade: the lot of treason, corruption, and #issue[genocide][极端例证], etc. These reflect the deficiencies of the human soul, and one can almost be excused in saying the convicted is rotten to the core -- beyond redemption. Education is #typo[irrelavant][irrelevant] for such inborn faults. The only verdict is imprisonment, or even #issue[the chair][美国口语，不正式。可替换为“capital punishment”或“the death penalty”].

To conclude, education can be preferable to prison for some specific categories of crimes, but not as a general solution. The final decision should be made on a case-by-case basis in consideration of the socio-economic and psychological origin of the offence in question. #issue[][结尾略显仓促]]

#评价(tr: 7, cc: 7.5, lr:7, gra: 7)[
- 优点：
  + 你明确表达了立场：“教育对某些犯罪类型有效，但不能全面取代监禁”，并采用了“分类讨论”策略（经济型、暴力型、恶性型犯罪），逻辑清晰。
  + 每类犯罪都提供了具体例子（如 theft / gangsters / corruption），且尝试分析成因，这符合 Band 7+ 对“main ideas are extended and supported”的要求。

- 不足：
  + 结尾略显仓促。虽然提出了“case-by-case basis”，但没有进一步说明“如何判断”或“制度上如何设计教育干预”，缺乏更深层的政策性思考，略显抽象。
  + 对“更好教育”（better education）的具体内涵未界定。是指义务教育普及？职业教育？道德教育？还是心理辅导？若能具体化，论证会更扎实（Band 8 要求“well developed and supported ideas”）。

- 改进建议：在第二段或结尾补充一句，例如：“By ‘better education’, I refer not only to academic training but also to life skills, emotional regulation, and civic responsibility programs that address the root causes of anti-social behaviour.”
][
- 优点：
  + 段落结构清晰（引言 → 三类犯罪分析 → 结论），符合“logical progression”（逻辑推进）。
  + 使用了有效的衔接手段，如 “Take... for instance”, “Another category is...”, “Last but not least”, “To conclude”。

- 不足：
  + 第三段开头 “This is also the category…” 中的 “this” 指代稍显模糊（前文说的是“teenage dropout”，但读者可能误以为指“education”）。
  + 段内衔接可更精细。例如第二段结尾说 “education probably not effective”，但未自然过渡到第三段“education is most applicable”，中间缺乏转折词（如 “However, for other types of crime…”）。

- 改进建议：在段首加入逻辑路标，例如：“In stark contrast, crimes driven by social or psychological factors may respond more effectively to educational intervention.”
][
- 优点：
  + 使用了较丰富的词汇，如 “time-tested”, “socio-economic underpinning”, “economic subsistence”, “counter-productive”, “rotten to the core”, “inborn faults” 等，展现了词汇广度。
  + 尝试使用修辞（“seven sins”, “the chair”），增强文采。

- 不足：
  + 拼写错误：“proove” → prove、“robery” → robbery、“burglery” → burglary、“irrelavant” → irrelevant
  + 这些错误虽不影响理解，但会拉低 Lexical Resource 分数（Band 7 要求 “only a few errors”）。
  + 用词不当：
    - “the chair”（电椅）属美式口语化表达，在学术写作中建议用 capital punishment 或 execution。
    - “humanely-minded souls” 稍显文学化，可简化为 some argue 或 others contend。

- 改进建议：保持词汇多样性，但优先确保准确性与学术性。
][
- 优点：
  使用了复杂句结构，如条件句（“Can education remedy…?”）、让步状语（“one assumes -- or is it?”）、定语从句（“crimes… which cover…”），体现语法灵活性。

- 改进建议：检查拼写后，语法基本可达到 Band 7+，但要冲击 Band 8，需确保“the majority of sentences are error-free”。]

#范文[The role of incarceration in deterring crime has long been accepted as a cornerstone of criminal justice. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that investing in quality education may offer a more sustainable and humane approach to reducing recidivism and preventing criminal behaviour in the first place. While imprisonment remains necessary for serious and violent offences, I largely agree that better education is a more effective long-term solution for many types of crime.

Prison serves primarily as a punitive and incapacitating measure. It removes offenders from society, offering immediate public safety, and may deter potential criminals through fear of confinement. Yet, its rehabilitative function is often limited. In many jurisdictions, overcrowded facilities and lack of programming mean inmates emerge no better equipped to reintegrate—sometimes even more hardened. Statistics consistently show high rates of reoffending, particularly among non-violent offenders, suggesting that incarceration alone fails to address the underlying causes of crime.

By contrast, education tackles these root causes directly. Many crimes, such as theft, fraud, or drug-related offences, stem from poverty, unemployment, or lack of opportunity. A robust education system—particularly one that includes vocational training and social-emotional learning—can equip individuals with the skills, self-esteem, and prospects needed to lead lawful lives. Studies from countries like Norway and Finland, where rehabilitative education is central to the penal system, demonstrate significantly lower recidivism rates compared to purely punitive models.

That said, education is not a panacea. For heinous crimes involving extreme violence, sexual predation, or corruption by those in power, public safety demands incarceration. In such cases, the primary goal is not rehabilitation but societal protection and justice. Nevertheless, even within prisons, educational programs can reduce idleness and foster reflection, supporting eventual reintegration where appropriate.

In conclusion, while prison remains indispensable for the most dangerous offenders, a far more effective strategy for combating the majority of crime lies in prevention through inclusive, high-quality education. Societies that prioritise learning over locking up are likely to enjoy not only lower crime rates but also stronger social cohesion and economic productivity.]]
