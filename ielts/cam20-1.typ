=== Task 1
The first table below shows changes in the total population of New York City from 1800 to 2000. The second and third tables show changes in the population of the five districts of the city (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, Staten Island) over the same period.

- 优点：
  + 准确提炼了总人口增长趋势（1800年→2000年）。
  + 正确指出了曼哈顿人口占比显著下降（76% → 19%），并识别出人口向其他行政区转移的模式。
  + 尝试区分“比例变化”与“绝对数量变化”，体现了一定的数据分析能力。
- 不足：
  + 遗漏关键信息：未具体描述其他四个行政区（布鲁克林、布朗克斯、皇后区、斯塔滕岛）的人口变化趋势，尤其是布鲁克林和皇后区在20世纪的显著增长。Task 1要求“select and report the main features”，而仅聚焦曼哈顿会显得覆盖不全。
  + 数据准确性问题：原文称“the other 4 cities”，但纽约五个行政区（boroughs）并非“城市”，用词不当，可能引起误解。
  + 结尾仓促：未对整体趋势作简要总结（如“总体呈增长，但人口分布日趋均衡”）。
][
- 优点：
  + 段落结构清晰：总述→比例变化→绝对数量变化。
  + 使用了有效连接词（however、specifically、in the same period）。
- 不足：
  + 第三段开头In absolute terms however中however位置不当，应为however, in absolute terms（副词连接需注意语序）。
  + 第二段末at the turn of the century指代不清——2000年是20世纪之交还是21世纪之交？应明确写by 2000。
][
- 优点：
  + 使用了较地道的表达，如the bulk of the population、proportionally speaking、accounted for。
- 不足：
  + 重复使用population较多，可替换为residents、inhabitants、people等。
  + breakdown应为break down（动词短语需分开）。
  + the other 4 cities属于概念错误（应为boroughs或districts），影响准确性。
][
- 优点：
  + 能使用复合句（如even as the overall population increase had somewhat slowed）。
  + 大部分时态使用正确（过去时描述历史数据）。
- 不足：
  + 时态混乱：如the population in the other 4 cities had been increasing应为was increasing或increased——此处无需过去完成进行时。
  + 冠词/单复数：all population → the total population 或 all the population。

1. 图表中的内容尽量描述全面，不要有遗漏。不能自己觉得不重要就不写了。
2. 最后应该有个总结的段落。]


#范文[The charts illustrate New York City’s population growth and its distribution across five boroughs from 1800 to 2000.

Overall, the city’s total population surged from 80,000 to over 8 million, while the demographic centre shifted dramatically from Manhattan to the outer boroughs.

In 1800, Manhattan housed 76% of the city’s residents (60,000), but this share plummeted to 19% by 2000 despite its population peaking at 1.85 million in 1900. Conversely, Brooklyn and Queens saw explosive growth: Brooklyn’s share rose from 4% to 31%, and Queens’ from less than 1% to 28%. The Bronx and Staten Island also expanded steadily, though more modestly.

Thus, while Manhattan’s absolute population grew until 1900, its relative dominance eroded as the other four boroughs absorbed the bulk of the city’s growth in the 20th century.]


=== Task 2
Access to clean water is a basic human right. Therefore every home should have a water supply that is provided free of charge. Do you agree or disagree?]

#作文(words: 340, timing: 48, date: "2025-11-22")[Just because access to clean water is a basic human right doesn't mean that every home's water supply should be provided free of charge.#praise[][表达清晰，开篇直接表明观点]

#issue[][段首转折生硬]Now consider the opposite: when #issue[clean water is forced to be free of charge -- by law for example][表述不自然且太“白”。] -- then no water treatment plants can run at a profit, and that means nobody will go to the water treatment business, so no clean water will be provided, and everybody will lose. #praise[][通过假设免费供水的后果进行反向论证] #issue[Paid water is better than no water][简洁有力但略显口语化。优化建议：A priced resource is preferable to a nonexistent one.].

In consideration of the paramount importance of clean water, some governments may choose to heavily subsidize the water development and treatment sector, or even nationalize it. Even in this case, water is not free, for consumers still pay, though indirectly, through taxes. For poorer countries, this is not even an option.#praise[][进一步探讨政府补贴情况，说明即使补贴水也并非免费]

In conclusion, to argue for free clean water based on human rights is #typo[igorrant][ignorant] of economic realities and therefore #issue[doomed to fail][武断。避免极端用词。]. #praise[][总结全文观点，强调基于人权主张免费供水忽视经济现实会导致不良后果] If such bad policies are carried out, they will certainly lead to disastrous outcomes.]

#评价(tr: 6.5, cc: 7, lr:6.5, gra: 6.5)[
- 优点
  + 你明确表达了立场（不同意“水应免费”），并提出了核心论点：提供清洁水有成本，需由用户承担。
  + 你进一步探讨了“免费水”的后果（企业无利可图 → 无人运营 → 无水可用），并补充了“政府补贴”的可能性，显示出一定思辨能力。
  + 结尾重申观点，结构完整。

- 问题与扣分点
  + 论证不够充分：虽然提到了“成本”和“补贴”，但缺乏具体例子或数据支持（如某国免费水政策失败的案例，或水处理成本的具体构成）。这使得论证显得泛泛而谈（over-generalised），符合 Band 6 描述：“some supporting arguments... may be less relevant or inadequate”。
  + 忽略对立观点的深入回应：题目将“人权”作为前提，你仅用“经济现实”反驳，但未深入探讨“人权”与“公共服务定价”之间的复杂关系（例如：是否可免费保障基本用量，超量收费？）。这削弱了批判性思维深度。
  + 结论略显武断：如“doomed to fail”“disastrous outcomes”等表述过于绝对，缺乏 nuance（细微差别），不符合 Band 7+ 要求的“precision and balance”。

- 建议
  + 加入一个真实或合理的假设案例（如：某发展中国家尝试免费供水导致系统崩溃）。
  + 承认“人权”合理性，但指出“免费 $≠$ 无成本，可通过补贴/阶梯水价实现公平”。
][
- 优点
  + 段落结构清晰：引言 → 成本论 → 免费后果 → 补贴方案 → 结论。
  + 使用了基本逻辑连接词（This is because…, Now consider…, In conclusion…），信息推进自然。
  + 段内逻辑较连贯，读者能轻松跟上思路。
 
- 问题
  + 衔接手段较单一，缺乏多样性（如：furthermore, conversely, nevertheless, in this context 等）。
  + 第三段与第二段之间转折稍显生硬（可加 “One might argue that the government should cover the costs…” 引出补贴论）。
 
- 建议
  + 增加指代（如：this approach, such policies）和逻辑连接词的多样性，避免重复使用“so”“and”。
][
- 优点
  + 使用了 topic-specific 词汇：water treatment plants, toxic chemicals, subsidize, nationalize, economic realities。
  + 表达基本准确。

- 问题
  + 拼写错误：comsumers → consumers；igorrant → ignorant（这类错误在 Band 7 中应极少出现）。
  + 词汇重复：多次使用 clean water、free、pay，缺乏同义替换（如：potable water, complimentary access, cover the expenses）。
  + 搭配不当：“forced to be free of charge — by law” 表述 awkward，更自然说法是 “mandated to be provided free of charge by legislation”。
  + 用词略显口语化：“for that matter”, “who should bear the cost?”（疑问句在议论文中应谨慎使用）。

- 建议
  + 使用更正式、学术的表达；积累同义替换（如：cost → expense, financial burden；provide → supply, deliver）。
][
- 优点
  + 能使用复合句（如：“water has to be collected, treated and processed… until it is clean…”）。
  + 多数句子语法正确，不影响理解。

- 问题
  + 标点错误：“free of charge.” 后应为逗号（因后面是完整句子），但你用了破折号+句号，结构混乱。
  + 句子结构单一：多数为简单主谓宾或“because”从句，缺乏多样复杂结构（如：条件句、倒装、分词短语）。
  + 小错误：“the comsumers naturally”（拼写+语序，应为 consumers naturally 或 the consumers, naturally,）。

- 建议尝试使用
  + 条件句：“Were water to be provided free of charge, utilities would collapse.”
  + 分词结构：“Having to treat water to remove contaminants, providers incur substantial costs.”

1. 加快手速。大作文居然写了近50分钟！
2. 需要具体的例子或数据支撑。
3. 不能一边倒论述。须充分考虑反方观点合理性。]


#范文[While access to clean water is universally acknowledged as a fundamental human right, it does not logically follow that this essential resource should be supplied to every household without charge. A more pragmatic approach recognises that while the state has a duty to ensure equitable access, the actual provision of water involves substantial operational costs that must be sustainably financed.

The process of delivering potable water—sourcing, purification, distribution, and waste management—requires significant infrastructure investment and ongoing maintenance. Desalination plants, filtration systems, and pipeline networks all incur expenses that cannot be sustained indefinitely without revenue. If governments mandatorily impose free water supply, private enterprises would inevitably withdraw from the sector due to unprofitability, while public budgets in many nations, particularly in the developing world, are already stretched thin. The result would not be universal access, but rather systemic collapse and even greater inequity.

That said, this does not absolve governments of their moral obligation. Instead of free provision, a more viable model combines targeted subsidies with tiered pricing: basic water needs for drinking, cooking, and hygiene could be heavily subsidised or even free up to a certain quota, while excessive consumption is charged at market rates. Countries like South Africa and Singapore have implemented such systems successfully, balancing affordability, sustainability, and conservation.

In conclusion, conflating a human right with zero-cost delivery overlooks economic realities. Ensuring universal access to clean water is not about eliminating charges, but about designing intelligent, equitable financing mechanisms that uphold both human dignity and fiscal responsibility.]]
