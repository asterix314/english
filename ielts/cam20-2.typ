#作文(timing: 50, words: 205, date: "2025-12-08")[Beechwood Farm is surrounded by country road to the north-west and a winding river in the south, which crosses the coutry road and flows south-east ward before it bends up north again.

In the 1950s, the farm was divided by a field track in the middle. Between the track and the river lied, from west to the east, a fruit trees field, a soft fruits field, a vegetables field, and a living area which contained a chikens pen, a farmhouse, and a barn by the side of the track. To the north of the track is a pasture for sheep.

But today, Beechwood Farm has changed in quite a few places. First, the field track is upgraded to become roads. There is a new farm shop in the fruit trees field just beside the road. The old barn is converted to holiday cottages, and a new, smaller barn is added, connecting to the road. In what used to be the sheep pasture lie a camping field in the west where tents are made under the shade of a nice groove, and a power field in the east where many solar panels are erected. Both new fields come with a parking lot connected to the road.]

The two plans illustrate how the layout and land use of Beechwood Farm have evolved between 1950 and the present day.

In 1950, the farm was bisected by a central field track running from west to east. The southern section, situated between the track and the river, comprised four distinct areas aligned from west to east: an orchard, a soft fruit field, a vegetable plot, and a residential zone containing a farmhouse, a barn, and a chicken pen adjacent to the track. North of the track lay a single, expansive pasture dedicated to sheep grazing.

By contrast, the farm has been significantly reconfigured in the current layout. The original track has been upgraded into a network of paved roads providing access to all parts of the site. The orchard has been partially repurposed to accommodate a farm shop, while the former barn has been converted into holiday cottages; a new, smaller barn now stands nearby. Most notably, the northern pasture has been entirely transformed: the western half now serves as a camping area shaded by a grove of trees, and the eastern portion hosts a solar panel array. Both new facilities are complemented by dedicated parking lots connected to the road system.

Overall, while the farm’s basic orientation remains unchanged, its function has shifted markedly—from a purely agricultural operation towards a hybrid model incorporating rural tourism and renewable energy generation.]

=== Task 2
In many countries, primary and secondary schools close for two months or more in the summer holidays.
What is the value of long school holidays?

What are the arguments in favour of shorter school holidays?]

#作文(timing: 45, words: 340, date: "2025-12-08")[In many countries, mine included, schools close for about two months in the summer to give us the cherished "summer holidays". We also have the "winter holidays", too, though for a shorter length of time. These holidays have been taken for granted. But come to think of it, what is their value?

The first reason that comes to mind is that students need a respite from their arduous study. As the saying goes, "all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy", so the summer holidays serve as interludeds between periods of intense study, in which students can go abroad, to the beach, hiking or swimming, for a bit of adventure, or just some fresh air. The brain is in desperate need of a change of scene after months of immersing itself in knowledge.

What's more, some countries have the hottest summers on earth (think of the insane temperatures in India) and the heat becomes physically unbearable to stay in school buildings, especially if air conditioning is not available. For the same reason, adults customarily leave office to enjoy vacations in the summer, too, including teachers and school staff. In this case, summer holidays are practically mandatory.

The schools can use this time for renovations, organize teacher training, and run other repairatory operations that wouldn't be possible during the semesters. That's a third value.

This is all well and nice, but does the holidy really need to last for as long as two months, and in some cases even longer? It is a valid argument that's often heard, mostly from parents. Indeed, parents do not usually have long summer holidays, and it becomes some sort of an "inconvenience", to say the least, when they have to go to work and nobody was around to look after their naughty children who, left to their own devices, are prone to look for all sorts of trouble. So perhaps shorter summer holidays? My guess is that this proposal will meet with tremendous opposition from the students, so good luck with that :)]
