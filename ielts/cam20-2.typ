The two plans illustrate how the layout and land use of Beechwood Farm have evolved between 1950 and the present day.

In 1950, the farm was bisected by a central field track running from west to east. The southern section, situated between the track and the river, comprised four distinct areas aligned from west to east: an orchard, a soft fruit field, a vegetable plot, and a residential zone containing a farmhouse, a barn, and a chicken pen adjacent to the track. North of the track lay a single, expansive pasture dedicated to sheep grazing.

By contrast, the farm has been significantly reconfigured in the current layout. The original track has been upgraded into a network of paved roads providing access to all parts of the site. The orchard has been partially repurposed to accommodate a farm shop, while the former barn has been converted into holiday cottages; a new, smaller barn now stands nearby. Most notably, the northern pasture has been entirely transformed: the western half now serves as a camping area shaded by a grove of trees, and the eastern portion hosts a solar panel array. Both new facilities are complemented by dedicated parking lots connected to the road system.

Overall, while the farm’s basic orientation remains unchanged, its function has shifted markedly—from a purely agricultural operation towards a hybrid model incorporating rural tourism and renewable energy generation.]]
