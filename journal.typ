== Interview with the Vampire

As per a friend's recommendation, I just finished watching Season 1 of the 2022 TV series #highlight[Interview with the Vampire] and would like to thank her for directing me to such a high-quality production.

I only vaguely remember the earlier movie (2000s?) starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, but the TV series adds the element of race to the already complex Gothic horror + gay mix. Louis (the vampire being interviewed) is played by none other than "Grey Worm" from #highlight[Game of Thrones] — his handsome but often sad and wistful face makes him especially fitting for the role, I think. The struggles among Louis, Lestat, and later Claudia, the adopted girl, become particularly poignant towards the season's end, intertwining love, jealousy, hate, and betrayal into a dark and heart-wrenching masterpiece.

That said, the series isn't perfect in every aspect. For example, the storyline sometimes feels incongruous. Maybe it's just me, but how can Claudia hate Lestat so much that she wants to murder her Maker, and why does Louis, the sweet lover that he is, even acquiesce? Is it a vampire thing?

On the language side, I find myself looking up words and expressions in my dictionary (or asking DeepSeek to break down a sentence and explain its historical background) more often than I'd like. So it's definitely more advanced than, say, Friends. I'd rate it 8 out of 10 in terms of language difficulty.

== Childhood

The gray praying mantis attempting to escape its plastic prison was the first thing Monkey, my son, spotted when we arrived at the new playground in the neighborhood. I had a mantis back when I was not much older than Monkey, if my memory serves. It was green and quite large, which bit off the head of a grasshopper, captivating me as it continued to devour the corpse. But there's little time for my childhood flashbacks: Monkey dashes off towards the little mound full of handholds and tunnels, crying out in glee.

And so it went—mound-climbing, slide-riding, tunnel-crawling—it was clear that Monkey was enjoying himself, keeping busy with various explorations, running back and forth, and completely ignoring me. I had to content myself with occasionally shouting "be careful" and offering water when he was in the mood. And it was just right—who was I to interfere with his adventures? Perhaps in his mind, he had a world to save, a kingdom to conquer.

Eventually, he settled down, probably out of fatigue, to digging in the sand with some seriousness, underneath a long ramp. After a while, when he tried to stand up, he forgot about the ramp and bumped his head against the edge of it. I heard a clear thump, but he didn't mind, didn't even complain. That's how focused his mind is.

Yes, that focus of attention, the determination not to be disturbed, comes perhaps more easily to a child than to a grown-up like myself, whose mind is troubled by many worries and agitations. It is certainly one of the things I miss dearly about childhood.


== The Motionless Longtan Wheel

To my knowledge, the Ferris wheel in Longtan Park has stood motionless for some 30 years. Back then the park was known as the Beijing Amusement Park, a distinctive, fond place in the childhood memories of my generation. It was an indisputable royal treatment to have a go in the giant wheel, which already enjoyed landmark status in all of Beijing.

Not many people known this, but rumor had it that one day, one carriage on the Wheel caught fire and some students were burnt to their death. A terrifying tragedy. The amusement park had since shut down, becoming quite ruined for many years, a dilapidated, gloomy yet mysterious place in my memory, until only a couple of years ago when Longtan reopened as a normal park. The Wheel however has never been turned on again. A giant statue of sorts. A landmark. Its memory lost on the many happy faces wondering at its looming presence.





== Approaching Ancient Text

My approach to these texts is to treat them like an archaeological puzzle: I have arrived at an open field full of fossilized bones, as the texts are quite intimidating at first glance. The individual words I can recognize, yes, but the meaning of the sentences eludes understanding.

This is no doubt due to the texts' age—they were written hundreds of years ago in a scholarly style that is now almost extinct. But herein lies the intrigue: can I piece together these scattered relics and reconstruct the beast?

So, I repeatedly scan the text, trying to connect the dots. Each time, I gain a little more insight—a process involving much guesswork and reading between the lines—until at last the Tyrannosaurus rex emerges with a roar, and every word's purpose crystallized.

Ultimately, the messages of these texts are not so interesting; they are mostly personal opinions and empty philosophizing, reiterations of familiar ideas that have fallen out of fashion. But I can't honestly complain, for the chase is better than the catch :)
